            Happy 1 year, my love 🤍

            I can’t believe it’s already been a year since we started this journey together. So much has happened, and through everything, you’ve become such an important part of my life.

            Even when I’m busy with work and studying, please know that you are never “extra” or “secondary” in my world. You matter to me deeply. You are someone I choose, every day.

            This year wasn’t always easy especially with distance but I’m really grateful that we kept choosing each other. I’m grateful for your patience, your kindness, and the way you try to understand me even when it’s hard.

            You make me feel supported, loved, and safe. And I hope you know that you are important in my life not just as my partner, but as someone I truly value and respect.

            Thank you for staying.
            Thank you for loving me.
            And thank you for being you.

            I’m excited for what we’ll build in year two 🤍

            Forever cheering for us.
